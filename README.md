This is a project designed to retrieve a list of billable and non-billable ICD-10 codes from ICD10data.com.

After retrieving both lists, you may then provide a CSV with Chronic Care Management entries (see example).

The script will then create a CSV of every CCM entry that contains invalid ICD-10 codes.
